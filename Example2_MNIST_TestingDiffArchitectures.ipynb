    "## Testing performance of different neural network architectures on a subset of the MNIST data\n",
    "- Performance of neural networks with 4 and 5 layers compared with baseline architecture of 3 layers with 100 nodes in the hidden layers\n",
    "    - Networks with up to 40 fewer and 60 more nodes in total vs. baseline tested\n",
    "- Same cost function, activation functions, batch size, learning rate and number of epochs used so as to isolate performance difference from architecture only\n",
    "- Overall small difference in performance across all the networks: total variation in test set accuracy of 1%\n",
    "- Four layer neural network with 20 fewer nodes than baseline network marginally exceeds baseline performance. This is consistent with deep learning theory that demonstrates that it is possible to approximate the same function using fewer nodes and a deeper network\n",
    "- The best performance was from the 5 layer network with 60 more nodes vs. the baseline with a test set accuracy of 91.28%\n",
    "- Given that all of these networks achieve almost 100% accuracy on the training data, I suspect that the major performace limitation, particularly for the deeper networks, is the size of the training data."
